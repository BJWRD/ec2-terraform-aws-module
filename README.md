# Prerequisites
* An AWS Account with an IAM user capable of creating resources â€“ `AdminstratorAccess`
* A locally configured AWS profile for the above IAM user
* Terraform installation - [steps](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* AWS EC2 key pair - [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)

# How to Apply/Destroy
This section details the deployment and teardown of the three-tier-architecture. **Warning: this will create AWS resources that costs money**

## Deployment steps

### Applying the Terraform Configuration

#### 1.	Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/BJWRD/ec2-terraform-aws-module

#### 2.	Initialise the TF directory

    terraform init

#### 3.	 Ensure the terraform code is formatted and validated 

    terraform fmt && terraform validate

#### 4.	Create an execution plan

    terraform plan

#### 5.	Execute terraform configuration - Creating the EC2 Infrastructure

    terraform apply --auto-approve
